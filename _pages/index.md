# About

Hi, I'm Ning-Jing Yang! üëã I am a physicist by training, with a background in condensed matter theory ‚öõÔ∏è and topological quantum materials üß†. I have years of experience in theoretical modeling, first-principles calculations, and exploring novel topological phases in low-dimensional systems. Through combining symmetry analysis and computational tools, I aim to uncover new quantum phenomena with potential for next-generation electronic and spintronic devices. I envision a future where fundamental physics inspires transformative technologies, and believe that curiosity-driven research is key to this vision.
