## Higher-Order Topological Phase Transitions and Hall Effect

During my Ph.D., I focused on higher-order topological phase transitions in two-dimensional quantum materials, driven by the interplay of multiple internal degrees of freedom—including spin, layer, orbital, and valley. By combining tight-binding modeling with first-principles calculations, I revealed how spin–layer locking, interlayer ferroelectric sliding, and magnetic symmetry breaking can induce transitions between topologically distinct phases, giving rise to robust corner-localized states. I systematically explored the thermoelectric and transport signatures accompanying these transitions, including the anomalous Hall effect, the anomalous Nernst effect, and the thermal Hall effect. These Hall-type responses not only serve as effective probes of the topological phase boundaries, but also reflect the entangled nature of multiple degrees of freedom in higher-order topological states.
